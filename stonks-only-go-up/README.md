# Stonks Only Go Up Frontend

## Setup
The following are steps to setup and run this frontend React App:
1. Go to terminal and `cd` into the location you want to install the app.
2. Use `git clone https://github.com/agile-dev-assignments/project-setup-team-oras-protocol-sogu.git` to clone the repo into your local repository.
3. (**IMPORTANT**) Run `cd ../your-local-repo/stonks-only-go-up` or if you are already in the project's directory, you can run `cd stonks-only-go-up`
4. Run `npm install` to install any dependencies/packages.
5. Run `npm start`
6. If `localhost:3000` does NOT appear automatically in your browser, just put this into your browser

## Exiting Local Host
If you are trying to exit the `localhost:3000` being run then:
1. Go to terminal and press `control + c` on your KEYBOARD.
2. You could then refresh the the `localhost:3000` to ensure it is no longer running.

Note. to prevent the `localhost:3000` from running in the background of you application, could habit of just exiting the local host when you are done. It only stops the running too, not the code changes.

## Finishing
The following is what to follow AFTER you have added your code updates.
1. Run `git add .` or `git add some-files` to add the changes.
2. Run `git commit -m 'added some cool features!` to commit to staging directory.
3. Run `git push from-branch-local to-branch-remote` to push your changes to specified branch.

## Install Packages
To install ANY npm packages:
1. Go to website: `https://www.npmjs.com/` and search for the specific package you want to install
2. Run `npm i package-name` (ex. `npm i react-select` to install the react-select package!)

Note. you need to exit the `localhost:3000` first before installing the package (since you need to access the terminal to do so).
